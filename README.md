MancRiskScreenUI is a shiny interface for the Manchester Breast Cancer
Model, developed by Ewan Gray, Anna Donten, and Katherine Payne and
validated by Stuart Wright, Gabriel Rogers, Katherine Payne, and Rob
Hainsworth at the Manchester Centre for Health Economics.

<!-- ## Installation -->
<!-- You can install the development version of MancRiskScreenUI from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- # install.packages("devtools") -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("stuwrighthealthecon/MANC-RISK-SCREEN") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ## Example -->
<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->
<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(MancRiskScreenUI) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
